The R Shiny application is compatible with all input formats that the R package "rio" is capable of processing. Once the data has been uploaded, the user is able to view the data structure by accessing the first two tabs. The first tab provides a concise overview of the first ten rows of the data, while the second tab presents a summary of the uploaded data. After selecting the desired main variables and/or filters to be applied, the user must click the "Show the plot" button located at the end of the sidebar. The plot will then be available in the third tab.
